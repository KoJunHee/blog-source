## Definition 

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 

Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.

## Using the hook 

To use the hook, we override it in our subclass. 

Here, the hook controls whether the CaffeineBeverage evaluates a certain part of the algorithm; 

that is, whether it adds a condiment to the beverage. 

How do we know whether the customer wants the condiment? Just ask !
