## Definition

Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern when you want to give more than one object a chance to handle a request. 

## Class Diagram

## Example

![](/image/chain0302.png)

## Benefits

- Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers. 
- Simplifies your object because it doesn’t have to know the chain’s structure and keep direct references to its members. 
- Allows you to add or remove responsibilities dynamically by changing the members or order of the chain.
