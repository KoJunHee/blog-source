In the histogram equalization, the first and the second step are PMF and CDF.Â 

## What is PMF?

- probability mass function
-  it gives the probability of each number in the data set or 
- you can say that it basically gives the count or frequency of each element.

## How PMF is calculated

- Consider this matrix.

- Now if we were to calculate the PMF of this matrix, 

- here how we are going to do it.

- At first, we will take the first value in the matrix , and then we will count, how much time this value appears in the whole matrix. 

- After count they can either be represented in a histogram, or in a table like this below.

## Calculating PMF from histogram

- The above histogram shows frequency of gray level values for an 8 bits per pixel image.
- Now if we have to calculate its PMF, 
- we will simple look at the count of each bar from vertical axis and then divide it by total count.
- So the PMF of the above histogram is this.

## What is CDF?

- cumulative distributive function
- it is a function that calculates the cumulative sum of all the values that are calculated by PMF. 
- It basically sums the previous one.

## How CDF is calculated

- Since this histogram is not increasing monotonically, so will make it grow monotonically.

- the first value of PMF remain as it is. 

- The second value of PMF is added in the first value and placed over 128. 

- The third value of PMF is added in the second value of CDF , that gives 110/110 which is equal to 1.
