## Brightness 

- Brightness is a relative term. 

- It depends on your visual perception. 

- Since brightness is a relative term, so brightness can be defined as the amount of energy output by a source of light relative to the source we are comparing it to. 

- In some cases we can easily say that the image is bright, and in some cases, its not easy to perceive.

- Consider this black image of 5 rows and 5 columns

  ![](/image/bri01.png)

  ![](/image/bri02.png)

  ![](/image/bri03.png)

## Contrast

- Contrast can be simply explained as the difference between maximum and minimum pixel intensity in an image.

  ![](/image/bri05.png)

  - The maximum value in this matrix is 100.

  - The minimum value in this matrix is 100.

  - Contrast = maximum pixel intensity(subtracted by) minimum pixel intensity

    = 100 (subtracted by) 100

    = 0
